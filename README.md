# Context-Free-in-Jupyter-Notebook
Learn Context-Free using Jupyter notebook as an editor and execution platform

Jupyter makes a fantastic editor. The notebook can contain links,examples, snippits and more. A couple cells 
can even be used to create a database to save searchable information. Code may also be saved, searched and retrieved. 
* NOTICE Code must encoded base64 to be stored and then uncoded to display.

This repository also includes a notebook to create Sqlite and Mysqld databases. Mysql converts the "Code" field
to base64 and back to regular text for viewing and cut and paste. 

When using Sqlite I am having problems with convertin base64 back to regular text in a single step.
